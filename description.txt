This is the final project for the data toolkit class. Below, the used git commands are displayed:
     1. Initialize a new Git repository in your local project directory: git init
     2. Add files to the staging area: git add description.txt
        Add all files -> git add .
     3. Commit files: git commit -m "Initial commit"
     4. Add Remote Origin: In your local project directory, open a terminal or command prompt, then
                        git remote add origin https://github.com/912-Chereji-Iulia/market-prediction.git
     5. Push changes: git push -u origin main -> -u: This flag stands for "upstream." This option sets the local branch to track the remote branch.
                    After setting the upstream branch with -u, you can simply use git push or git pull in the future without specifying the branch name,
                    and Git will know you're referring to the main branch on the origin remote.
     6. Create branch: git checkout main -> git checkout -b feature/add-about-project ( create & switch )
     7. Switch between branches: git checkout main (if you want to go back to main branch)
     8. Pull changes: git fetch origin main -> git merge origin/main -> commit & push again
        or you can use: git pull origin main -> commit & push again
     9. Merge changes from 'feature/add-about-project' into 'main': git merge feature/add-about-project -> git push origin main
     10. Rebasing: It's a good practice to integrate the latest changes from the main branch into your feature branch before merging
        back into main -> on feature/add-about-project, use: git rebase main
     11. Check status of the repo: git status
